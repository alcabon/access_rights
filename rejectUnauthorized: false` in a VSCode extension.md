You're absolutely right to be concerned about potential issues when using `rejectUnauthorized: false` in a VSCode extension environment. Let me search for specific information about this.

Excellent research! 

You've identified a **critical issue** that could affect our VSCode extension. Based on the search results, there are indeed known problems with `rejectUnauthorized: false` in VSCode extensions. Let me provide you with a comprehensive analysis and improved solution:

## **Known VSCode Extension Issues**

VSCode has specific issues where `rejectUnauthorized: false` doesn't work properly in extensions, even though the same code works fine in standalone Node.js. This became particularly problematic starting with VSCode 1.55.0.

## **Why This Happens**

VSCode extensions don't benefit from the same proxy support that VSCode itself supports, and several features don't fully support proxy networking. The VSCode runtime environment has different SSL handling than standard Node.js.

## **Improved Solution**

Let me create an improved version that handles these VSCode-specific issues:

## **Key Improvements for VSCode Compatibility**

### **1. Multi-Strategy Approach**
- **Primary**: Standard `node-fetch` with custom HTTPS agent
- **Fallback**: Environment variable bypass (VSCode-specific)
- **Last Resort**: User guidance for VSCode limitations

### **2. Enhanced HTTPS Agent**
```typescript
checkServerIdentity: () => undefined, // Bypass server identity check
secureProtocol: 'TLS_method', // Flexible TLS method
ciphers: 'ALL', // Accept all ciphers
```

### **3. VSCode-Specific Error Handling**
- Detects SSL/certificate errors
- Provides actionable guidance to users
- Opens VSCode settings or documentation when needed

### **4. Environment Variable Fallback**
- Temporarily sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`
- Safely restores original value
- Works around VSCode extension limitations

## **Additional Recommendations**

### **For Users with Persistent Issues:**

1. **VSCode Settings**: Add `"http.proxyStrictSSL": false` to VSCode settings
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` pointing to certificate bundle
3. **System Certificates**: Import certificates to OS certificate store and use VSCode's system certificate option

### **For Extension Distribution:**
Consider adding a documentation note about VSCode SSL limitations and potential workarounds for corporate environments.

This solution provides maximum compatibility while maintaining security as the default, and handles the VSCode-specific SSL certificate issues you correctly identified.
